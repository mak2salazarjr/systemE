# systemE
A lightweight systemd replacement written in Emacs lisp

## About

Using the tooling in this repo, I am able to boot from linux to sinit as PID1, and from there to Emacs acting as PID2 using --script mode, performing all typical rc.boot system initialization using Emacs lisp until we hit the getty.

Additionally from the getty, I use Emacs as a login shell, dotfiles manager, package-manager front-end, startx / xinitrc replacement, and Window Manager. I have nearly purged shell scrips from my life entirely. For more information about these things, see my [.emacs repo](https://github.com/a-schaefers/dotfiles).

## Status

- The boot.el and shutdown.el scripts are finished and I use them on my local machine. No support for fancy stuff like luks is planned.

- We still depend on [suckless.org's](http://suckless.org) sinit for PID1 and this needs to be rewritten in in elisp.

- We still depend on busybox runit for a process supervisor and this needs to be reimplemented in elisp, or atleast converted to gnu shepherd.

- One pain point is getting a statically compiled Emacs. We don't require this, but it sure would be nice. Unfortunately, when I statically compile Emacs using musl, it results in a broken Emacs.

## This repo is technically a [kiss linux](https://getkiss.org) package

I don't recommend you install this as a package if you use Kiss Linux though. Instead I would recommend you poke around at it and see if you find anything that is useful for yourself that way.

I took some shortcuts in packaging it and it is not an exemplary example of a kiss package. It's very hacky. However, it does display the flexibility and simplicity which makes the kiss package manager fun to work with.

So this repo compiles and installs all of my project dependencies "batteries included" to /boot ...

This includes:
- emacs-nox
- elisp files
- sinit
- ubase
- sbase
- dash
